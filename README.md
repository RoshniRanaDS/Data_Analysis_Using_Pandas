# Created And Manipulated Pandas DataFrames To Analyze School, Student's Budgets And Standardized Test Data.

# Background
As You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. 
In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Repo Instructions

Created a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge, Cloned the new repository to local by terminal.

Inside my local Git repository, created a folder for "PyCitySchools"

Added Jupyter notebook "(PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb)" to this folder. This is the main script to run for analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files i have used. 

Also this folder that contains pdf file that has the results from the conducted analysis.

Pushed these changes to GitHub profile by bash terminal.

# Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Report is included a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Check out the sample solution called "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" located in the "PyCitySchools" folder
to review the desired edges for this analysis.

# District Summary
Performed the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
